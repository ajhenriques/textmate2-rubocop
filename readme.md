#A TextMate 2 bundle for [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

Rubocop bills it self as  "A robust Ruby code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide"
Basically it wil get grumpy at you for having bade code

I've only tested this on TextMate2, if you're stil on TextMate1 can you let me know if this bundle works (or not)
