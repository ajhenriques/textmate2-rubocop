A [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) bundle for [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

Rubocop bills it self as "A robust Ruby code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide"
Basically it wil get grumpy at you for having bade code.

Analysis can be performed on the current working file, or on a selection of files or folders.
