#TextMate 2 rubocop

A [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) bundle for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop).

RuboCop bills itself as "A Ruby static code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide".
Basically it will get grumpy at you for having bad code.

Analysis can be performed on the current working file or on a selection of files or folders.

##Installation

The easiest way to install the bundle is via git. *If you're running 10.8 it's already installed on your mac*

1. `git clone git@github.com:mrdougal/textmate2-rubocop.git ~/Desktop/rubocop.tmbundle`
2. Double click the `rubocop.tmbundle`.
3. TextMate will lauch and ask you if you'd like to install the bundle.

If for some reason you don't have Git, or you don't like it:

1. Download the code.
2. Extract the package.
3. Rename the folder to `rubocop.tmbundle` and choose Use `.tmbundle` extension.
4. TextMate will lauch and ask you if you'd like to install the bundle.


##Not tested on TM1

I've only tested this on TextMate2, if you're still on TextMate1 can you let me know if this bundle works (or not).
