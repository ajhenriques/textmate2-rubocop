#TextMate 2 rubocop

A [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) bundle for [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

Rubocop bills it self as "A robust Ruby code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide"
Basically it wil get grumpy at you for having bade code.

Analysis can be performed on the current working file, or on a selection of files or folders.

##Installation

The easiest way to install is with git. *If you're running 10.8 it's already installed on your mac*

    git clone git@github.com:mrdougal/textmate2-rubocop.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/rubocop.tmbundle


If for some reason you don't have Git, or you don't like it

* Download the code
* Extract the package
* Rename the folder to 'rubocop.tmbundle' and choose Use .tmbundle Extension
* Double click on the new folder and TextMate will handle the rest!
